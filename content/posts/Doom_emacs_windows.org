[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom-emacs]]. It's a configuration framework for Emacs. Basically, it overrides the Emacs keybindings with most of vim's.

As I mentioned in the last post. I started using Emacs at work due to org-mode... and work PC's use windows behind a Firewall, so using git, pip, melpa and some more are useless in my work desktop (In the Laptop all of them work if I connect to another network, which was what I did).

As you can imagine, Doom is for a GNU program so Windows support is limited (because, who cares?). The [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#on-windows][guide]] is poor, it describes how to install it with scoop/chocolatey (that don't work with a firewall). However, you can use the git-bash to install Doom without scoop/chocolatey.
Here is how you do it:

* What you need
If you have limited permissions in Windows PC (e.g. admin privileges), you might not be able to use Chocolatey/Scoop.
However, you can still use =git-bash.exe= portable version!
  - Download [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][git]].
  - Download [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases][Ripgrep]] and [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases][fd]]. Make sure you download the =windows-gnu= version.
  - Of course, download [[http://ftp.wayne.edu/gnu/emacs/windows/][emacs]].
Extract the binaries[fn:: with binaries I mean the .exe] from =Ripgrep= and =fd= to their respective folders and place them where you want.
  - You should have one folder for =Ripgrep= and another for =fd=.
Extract emacs and place it where you want.
It does not matter where they are, we will add them to the =Path= later (but keep them
safe and where you can remember).

* Instructions
** Edit system environment variables
- Go to =Control panel -> User Accounts -> Change my environment variables=.
  + =New=, type =HOME= and set your =C:\Users\USERNAME= and =OK=.
  + Select =Path=, =edit= and add your =C:\path\to\the\emacs\bin= folder and =OK=.
  + Select =Path=, =edit= and add your =C:\path\to\the\ripgrep= folder and =OK=.
  + Select =Path=, =edit= and add your =C:\path\to\the\fd= folder and =OK=.
  + Click =Ok=.
- We still need to add =C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\bin=; but first download Doom
  files.
** Install Doom
- Open =git-bash.exe=
- Type =cd ~=
- Run: =git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d=
- After the download is completed, type =cd ~/.emacs.d/bin= and run: =./doom install=
- If everything is fine, Doom is now installed.
- Just in case run =./doom sync=
- Go to =Control panel -> User Accounts -> Change my environment variables=.
  - Select =Path=, =edit= and add =C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\bin=, click =OK -> OK=.
- Now you can start emacs and will see the Doom dashboard!
** All the icons
By default all-the-icons will not be enabled in Windows.
- If all-the-icons is not installed. Open emacs and =M-x package-install RET all-the-icons RET=.
- =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= select where to download the fonts and
  install them (double click -> install).
- Restart emacs and there you go.
** From one PC to another
If one of your PCs does not have internet connection or is under a firewall, you can:
- Copy your =~/.doom.d ~/.emacs.d ripgrep fd emacs= folders directly to the
  other PC (=~/.domm.d ~/.emacs.d= go in =C:\Users\USERNAME=)
- Edit the system environment variables accordingly.
- Copy and install the fonts you downloaded with =all-the-icons=
- Open =git-bash.exe=, =cd ~/.emacs.d/bin= and run: =./doom sync=
- /et voilÃ !/.
** Emacs server
If you use emacs server, Doom will place the server file in
=C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\.local\cache\server= folder.
- Go to =Control panel -> User Accounts -> Change my environment variables=.
  + =New= type =EMACS_SERVER_FILE= and set the file path =C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\.local\cache\server\server=.
  + Create a =emacsclientw.exe= shortcut with =emacsclientw.exe -nc= in target,
    run emacs server and emacsclientw will work.

Now, rejoice!
