[[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is an Emacs mode for note taking, project planing and making TODO lists (because we all need TODO lists to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][GTD]]). It can handle more things: Calendar, diary, agenda and export you Org documents to other file extensions. I am not going do talk about all can do with org-mode, you can google yourself for further information. I am going to focus in note taking and export.
* The org file
It all starts with a file with a =.org= extension. Create one in Doomemacs with =SPC .= and name it "myfile.org". By default a template should fill the title like:
#+BEGIN_SRC none
#+TITLE: Myfile
#+END_SRC
This is part of the heading of the document. Here you can specify some options like the author, email, date or disable the table of contents (toc).
#+BEGIN_SRC none
#+AUTHOR: Some Author
#+EMAIL: Some@email.com
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+END_SRC
After this, the body of the document begins. You start a headline with =*= and two of them =**= indicate a subheadline. You can specify verbatim text between =~|~=, code inside ==|==, italics surrounded by =/|/= and bold text inside =*|*=. (The | indicates the cursor position, or where you write your text).
#+BEGIN_SRC none
* Heading 1
** Heading 1.1
This is ~verbatim~, =code=, /italics/, *bold* and _underlined_ as well.
#+END_SRC
* Lists and TODO's
For simple bullet list you can start it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC none
- Item one
- Item 2
#+END_SRC
or numbered list
#+BEGIN_SRC none
1. First.
2. Second.
#+END_SRC
The cool thing, is that pressing =Alt-RET= (alt-enter) will automatically take you to the next line keeping the counting of the items (e.g. If you are in item "2. Second" and press =Alt-RET= the next item will be "3. |").

To insert a TODO just type: "* Buy milk" and then press =SPC m t t= to mark it as a TODO. Or press =Shift-Right/Left= to change the state from "TODO" to "DONE"

#+BEGIN_SRC none
* TODO Buy milk.
* WAIT Get money to but milk.
* DONE Get a Job.
#+END_SRC
* Blocks, comments & quotes
To start a block just write (ignore the "." at the beginning):
#+BEGIN_SRC none
.#+BEGIN_SRC NameOfTheLanguageCode

.#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC
Quotes and comments are similar

#+BEGIN_SRC none
#+begin_quote

#+end_quote
#+BEGIN_COMMENT

#+END_COMMENT
#+END_SRC
* Tables, figures & links
Yes, we can have tables. Use "|" and type "name", again "|", type "Phone" and press =TAB=. You will see how Emacs starts to arrange the table fitting automatically the width according to the content.
#+BEGIN_SRC none
| Name  | Phone | Age |
|-------+-------+-----|
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
#+END_SRC
Inserting a figure is simple as typing: =[[/path/to/the/image][desciption]]=. If you press =zi= in DoomEmacs it will call the function =org-toggle-inline-images= and will display the image you set in the document.

The same syntax is used for the links, just type: =[[url][desciption]]=

In DoomEmacs you can press =SPC m l l= to insert links and files/images.

* Final thoughts
The great thing about org-mode is that you can fold/unfold the sections of the document, to navigate quickly trough the notes, and export this plain text document (Yes, if you open the org file in a notepad you will see just plain text, is Emacs that renders the plain text) to a more common document types such as:
- Org document --> LaTeX document -> PDF document.
- Org document --> ODT document (the free alternative to Microsoft doc files, look at [[https://www.libreoffice.org/][LibreOffice]] project).
- Org document --> [[https://www.markdownguide.org/][Markdown]] document (another plain text format).
- Org document --> html document.
- Org document --> Plain text document.

You can export from one to another document with [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]], which was meant to convert from Markdown to any type of document. As the Pandoc's page says:
#+begin_quote
If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife. Pandoc can convert between the following formats.
#+end_quote
And there are several formats. However, for simple day-life PDF, html, ODT and plain text (for emails) the Emacs org-export works fine.

As an example, an org document can look like this
{{< figure src="/posts/img/orgmode-sample.png" title="" >}}
