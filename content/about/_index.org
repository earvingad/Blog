Google that and thank me later.

I'm a nerd who likes linux (I use Arch, BTW), Emacs, writing in LaTex, learning and sharing.
I'm not a coder, I just like that my laptop boots in less than 10 seconds.

You can find me at [[https://twitter.com/EarvingArciga][twitter]] and [[https://www.instagram.com/earvingad/][Instagram]] where I share other kind of stuff.
